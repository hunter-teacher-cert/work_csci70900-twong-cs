4.11 Exercise 1

1. When ping() is invoked, a period (".") will be displayed and a new line will be started. 
When baffle() is invoked, "wug" will be displayed and ping() will be invoked. In other words, 
"wug." will be displayed and a new line will be started. When zoop() is invoked, baffle() will 
be invoked, "You wugga " will be displayed, and then baffle() will be invoked again. In other 
words, "wug. [line break] You wugga wug."

Execution always begins at the first line of main. The output of the program, with line breaks 
and spacing, is the following:

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug. 

2. Stack diagram showing the state of the program the first time ping() is invoked:
	_______________________
main	| print(No, I )	       |
	|______________________|
zoop	| print()	       | //nothing is printed	
	|______________________|
baffle	| print(wug)	       |
	|______________________|
ping	| print(.)	       |
	|______________________|

3. If baffle() is invoked at the end of the ping method, it will create an infinite loop
of "wug." being displayed. This is because the baffle method invokes the ping method. Since
they will invoke each other with no stopping condition, they will run forever. The output
of the program would be:

wug.
wug.
wug.
... (repeating forever)
