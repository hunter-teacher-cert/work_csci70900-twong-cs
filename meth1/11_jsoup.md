# Intro to JSoup:
- Libraries and Scraping and HTML, Oh My!
## Instructions for Setup:
- git pull class repo to get wikipedia.java and .jar file
## Practice Exercise:
- Notice & Wonder: list as code comments what you think each line / block in Wikipedia.java does.
- Compile, run, and debug Wikipedia.java, using example on Jsoup homepage.
- Change the code to scrape something *other* than headlines from the wikipedia homepage **OR** to scrape from a *different* wikipedia page **OR** change the formatting of the output (i.e., not bold etc.). In essence, *change* something about the routine.
## Final Task:
- Choose a webpage of your own, and choose what to scrape from the page, and how to scrape it.
- (Note: we would provide some sample sites to choose from, i.e., NYT and CNN.)
- Create a java file with your code (you can use the Wikipedia.java file as a starting point).
- Discussion Question: Why might this library be useful? What else can you do with it?
- Discussion Question: What might some other applications of data scraping be?
