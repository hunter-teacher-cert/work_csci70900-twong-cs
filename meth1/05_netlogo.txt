SWBAT create turtles and write simple commands.

Aim: How can we alter turtle appearance and behavior in Netlogo?

Activity:
1. Explore what the commands "create-turtles 1," "create-turtles 4," and "clear-all" do.\
2. Upon inspecting turtles, change their color, heading (orientation), xcor, ycor, pen down, etc.\
3. Explore the following code (given without comments) - change values and colors. Insert comments with what each command does.

to setup
  clear-all
  crt 3                           ;; make 3 turtles
  ask turtle 0                    ;; tell the first one...
    [ fd 1 ]                      ;; ...to go forward
  ask turtle 1                    ;; tell the second one...
    [ set color green ]           ;; ...to become green
  ask turtle 2                    ;; tell the third one...
    [ rt 90 ]                     ;; ...to turn right
end

4. Now, explore the following code without comments, and insert comments on what each command does. (Do not worry about code concerning ticks - to be discussed later.)

to setup
  clear-all
  create-turtles 10
  reset-ticks
end

to go
  ask turtles [
    fd 1            ;; forward 1 step
    rt random 10    ;; turn right
    lt random 10    ;; turn left
  ]
  tick
end

5. Compare and contrast the two code segments. What lines of code do the same thing? Did the turtles behave how you expected them to?

6. Create simple program that meets goals outlined with number of turtles and how they behave.
