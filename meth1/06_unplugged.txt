Learning goal: SWBAT explain how:
(1) objects are created from classes, and
(2) class attributes hold data about the object.

Vocabulary: object, class, attributes

As students walk in the room, each is given a card: playing card, Uno card, Yu-Gi-Oh card, etc.
Students are asked to find others like themselves.

Elicit:
Each type of card is an object created from its own class (i.e. Uno cards have an Uno class).
Each card has attributes such as number, suit, color, type, etc.
A class is like a template with defined attributes to create objects/instances.
Member methods defined in each class can only be used on objects in that class.

Discussion / Questions:
 "What does it mean to find others like yourself? How did you group yourselves?"
 "What similarities/differences do you see between you and other people in your group?"
 "Compare the attributes (instance vars) of a Yu-Gi-Oh card and a playing card."
 "Can we play an Uno card in defense mode, like red7.playDefenseMode()? Why doesn't that make sense?"
 "How might we extend this idea to other things?"
 --> Every car has a certain number of doors, wheels, and engines.
 --> Every Chipotle burrito has a choice of protein, rice, and beans.
